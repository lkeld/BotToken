  <h2> Congratulations, You have now obtained your discord bot token. Note that if you are coding and publishing to github that you don't accidentally leave your bots token on the repository. Your token will be automatically reset if you do end up publishing it onto the internet and you will need to replace the token in your bots code </h2>
